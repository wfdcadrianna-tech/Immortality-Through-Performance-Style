      <h2>Ending 3: Immortal Prison</h2>
      <p>You accept the offer of immortality, becoming a hologram yourself. Preserved forever, you are adored by society, but quickly realize the suffering of those before you. You are trapped in an endless cycle of performing, with no freedom to ever put an end to the cycle. Immortality comes at the highest cost: freedom.</p>
