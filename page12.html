      <h2>Ending 2: Liberation</h2>
      <p>You sabotage the first annual festival and release the holograms of the dead celebrities. Society is divided on your decision. Some praise you for giving new artists a chance and restoring creativity and culture, while others shame you for taking away their joy. You are both the hero and the villain, depending on who tells the story.</p>
