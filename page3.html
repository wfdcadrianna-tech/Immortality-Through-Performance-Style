      <h2>The Protest</h2>
      <p>Outside the arena, you notice a family protesting. They claim Forever Entertainment, the company behind these hologram performances, used their deceased father's image without their consent and, twisted his legacy for profit. They plead with you to help them protest and shut the company down to protect emerging artists.</p>
