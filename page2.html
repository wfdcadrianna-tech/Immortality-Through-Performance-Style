      <h2>The CEOâ€™s Offer</h2>
      <p>The performance ends with an overwhelming applause. Shortly after you exit the arena, the CEO of Forever Entertainment approaches you. You've heard this name before, but where? You come to realize this company is the same one who creates the hologram celebrities for performances. He hands you his card. He then provides you with an offer, an offer to design these performances and bring dead artists back.</p>
