      <h2>They Speak</h2>
      <p>One night at the company, you stay later to finish up a project once again. You're exhausted, and can't tell if you are hearing things or if they're actually happening. However, you're convinced you can hear the voice from before beneath your office. “This isn’t what I wanted… let me go. You can't ignore it any longer, and you go to investigate this once and for all.”</p>

      <p>

        <a href="page8.html">Ignore the voice and keep working</a>
