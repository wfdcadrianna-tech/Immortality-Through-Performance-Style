      <h2>About the Author</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Adrianna Farris, and I created the <em>Immortality Through Performance</em> narrative. This narrative was created for my Fundamentals of Interactive Design course, and it has helped me immensely in understanding the process of interactive design. I am currently attending the University of Central Florida with a major in Entertainment Management, as well as a minor in Digital Media. I sincerely hope you enjoy.</p>
