      <h2>Ending 1: The Eternal Festival</h2>
      <p>You allow the first annual festival of Forever Entertainment to commence.. Society is content with eternal performances, but it becomes bland and unoriginal. Culture stops evolving, nothing new is created. Everyone applauds, but the applause is for repetition, not innovation. A society of no evolution. Society continues to spiral with less and less creativity in the world, content with a facade.</p>
